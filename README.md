# 24-Week AI-Aware Cybersecurity Transition Project

This repository documents my self-directed, hands-on 24-week journey into cybersecurity.

I am transitioning into cybersecurity **with no formal training**, so I designed and built my own structured program focused on:

- AI-aware phishing detection  
- GRC governance  
- SOC automation  
- Red Team simulations (safe & synthetic)  
- Purple Team detection improvements  
- Deepfake + voice cloning defensive analysis  

The project models modern social engineering threats inspired by groups like **Scattered Spider**, and turns them into:
- A real detection pipeline  
- Governance controls  
- Operational workflows  
- Automation logic  
- Weekly progress documentation

## 🔥 What This Project Demonstrates

### **Governance (GRC)**
- A full Social Engineering SOP  
- Risk scoring  
- Escalation paths  
- Change-control & compliance logs  

### **Detection Engineering / SOC**
- n8n automation workflows  
- LLM-based phishing classification  
- Threat Intel enrichment  
- Multi-channel detection (email, SMS, voice, video)  
- Slack/webhook alerting  
- JSON/Sheets logging  

### **AI-Aware Defense**
- Deepfake forensics (image & video anomaly detection)
- AI voice cloning detection (prosody & embedding comparison)

### **Red Team Simulations**
(Safe, non-operational)
- MFA fatigue  
- AI-generated phishing lures  
- Typosquatting scenarios  
- Vishing scripts  
- Deepfake-driven scenarios  

### **Purple Team Loop**
- Attack → Detect → Analyze → Fix → Re-test  
- Before/after detection improvements  
- Weekly reports
